## Installing Testcord Devbuild — recommended

### Dependencies

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.JS LTS](https://nodejs.org/) are required.

Install `pnpm`:

> ❗ This next command may need to be run as admin/root depending on your system, and you may need to close and reopen your terminal for pnpm to be in your PATH.

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

> ❗ **IMPORTANT** — Make sure you aren't using an admin/root terminal from here onwards. It will mess up your Discord/Testcord instance and you will most likely have to reinstall.

Clone Testcord:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/x2b1/TestCord
cd TestCord
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Build Testcord:

```sh
pnpm build
```

You can also build dev (additional plugins) (not required):

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Inject Testcord into your desktop client:

```sh
pnpm inject
```

Build Testcord for web:

```sh
pnpm buildWeb
```

After building Testcord's web extension, locate the appropriate ZIP file in the `dist` directory and follow your browser's guide for installing custom extensions, if supported.

> Note: Firefox extension zip requires Firefox for Developers
