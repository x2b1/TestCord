# Introduction

Testcord is a community project and welcomes any kind of contribution from anyone!


> [!IMPORTANT]
> All contributions must follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to contribute

Contributions are submitted through pull requests. If you are new to Git or GitHub, we recommend reading [this guide](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github).

Pull requests can target either the `main` or `dev` branch.
Unless you are experienced and know what you are doing, **always target `main`**. The `dev` branch may contain unstable changes and can be force-pushed frequently, which may break your pull request.

## Writing a Plugin

Developing a plugin is the primary way to contribute.

Before starting your plugin:

- Join our Discord server.
- Check existing pull requests to avoid duplicate work.
- If no request exists, open one and clearly state that you want to work on it yourself.
- Wait for feedback before starting development, as some ideas may not be accepted or may need adjustments.
- Familiarize yourself with the plugin rules below.

> [!WARNING]
> Skipping these steps may result in your plugin being rejected, even if it is technically correct.

## Plugin Rules

To keep TestCord stable, secure and maintainable, all plugins must follow these rules:
1. Fuck rules i wanna create a client wout any restrictions, just dont make plugins that will hack the user using it (this rule doesnt apply to other people tho)

**Plugins that violate any of these rules will not be accepted.**

## Improving Testcord Itself

If you want to improve Testcord beyond plugins, such as internal features or performance improvements, you are welcome to open a feature request so it can be discussed.

Bug fixes, refactors, and documentation improvements are also highly appreciated!
